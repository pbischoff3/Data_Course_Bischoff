1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
From a p-value that we pull from an anova test, none of our data was scientifically meaningful. The p-value is greater than .05 in each circumstance
2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
Stat_smooth would allow one to plot the model of the data. 
Model <- lm(response ~ poly(predictor, 2, raw = TRUE), data = non_linear_relationship)
