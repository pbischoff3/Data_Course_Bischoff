## Intro

Why hello, everyone. Welcome to my Skills Exam 3. This was a fun one. We were able to use just about everything we learned in class, and that was pretty dope. Let's dive in.
<br>
<br>

## Load and Clean Faculty Data

First off, we added our packages and our "FacultySalaries_1995.csv" data to our R script. We then cleaned it up a little. Check it out:
<br>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load Packages ####
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(modelr)
library(easystats)
library(broom)
# Load and Clean Faculty Salaries####
faculty <- read_csv("./FacultySalaries_1995.csv")
glimpse(faculty)

faculty <- janitor::clean_names(faculty)

faculty <- faculty %>% 
  select(-ends_with("_comp")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("num_")) %>% 
  select(-ends_with("_comp_all")) %>% 
  select(-ends_with("_salary_all")) %>% 
  filter(tier != "VIIB")

faculty <- faculty %>% 
  rename(
    full = avg_full_prof_salary,
    assist = avg_assist_prof_salary,
    assoc = avg_assoc_prof_salary
  )

faculty <- faculty %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(full,assoc,assist),
               names_to = "rank",
               values_to = "salary")
glimpse(faculty)
```
<br>

Sweet, looks like it is all loaded and ready to go. In the assignment, we were told to recreate a box-and-whisker plot, which was a party. Here is the code for that:
<br>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create Box-and-Whisker####
faculty %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rank,y=salary,fill=rank))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~tier)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size=14))
```
<br>
Now, that chart is beautiful, and if you want to print it off and put it on your wall, but you can do that yourself. You have the R code lol.
<br>
<br>

## Build ANOVA 
<br>
Our next goal was to create an ANOVA from this data. We applied this ANOVA according to State, Tier, and Rank on Salary. Here it is:
<br>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ANOVA test according to State Tier and Rank on Salary ####
anova <- aov(salary ~ state + tier + rank, data = faculty)
summary(anova)
```
<br>
What does this mean? You decide. Analyzing the data wasn't part of my assignment. ;)

<br>
<br>

## Load and Clean Juniper Data
<br>

We took a pivot for the next part of the assignment, working with a new data set. We loaded that data set and cleaned it up a bit. Many thanks to Zahn for providing the names of the oils so I didn't have to type them all out. Here is the cleaning of the data:

<br>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load juniper_oils.csv and clean ####
oil <- read_csv("./Juniper_Oils.csv")
glimpse(oil)

oil <- oil %>% 
  select(c("alpha-pinene","para-cymene","alpha-terpineol","cedr-9-ene","alpha-cedrene","beta-cedrene",
           "cis-thujopsene","alpha-himachalene","beta-chamigrene","cuparene","compound 1","alpha-chamigrene",
           "widdrol","cedrol","beta-acorenol","alpha-acorenol","gamma-eudesmol","beta-eudesmol","alpha-eudesmol",
           "cedr-8-en-13-ol","cedr-8-en-15-ol","compound 2","thujopsenal","YearsSinceBurn")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

oil <- oil %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !years_since_burn,
               names_to = "chemical_id",
               values_to = "concentration")
glimpse(oil)
```
<br>
It's all loaded. Let's play with it now. 
<br>
<br>

## Graph the Data
<br>

Our next steps in the assignment was to recreate a set of graphs, with "Years_Since_Burn" on the x axis and "Concentration" on the y axis. We faceted these according to "chemicalID" with the y axis scales free. Here are those charts:
<br>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Graph with a facet ~chemical_id ####
oil %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=years_since_burn,y=concentration))+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~chemical_id, scales = "free_y")+
  theme_minimal()
```
<br>
Again, beautiful charts. Beautiful charts.
<br>
<br>

## Generalized Linear Model 
<br>

Awesome. Our next step, we created a GLM to view which chemical concentrations are significantly affected by the amount of years since the burn. Here is that info:
<br>
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# GLM to find significant chemicals ####
x <- oil %>% 
  glm(formula = concentration ~ years_since_burn + chemical_id,
      family = "gaussian")
summary(x)

x_adj <- broom::tidy(x)

x_adj <- x_adj %>% 
  filter(p.value<=.05)
print(x_adj)
```
<br>
Well, that's all folks. Thanks for checking it out.
